                <p>Kan and Gero (2005) proposed an explanation of Linkography using entropy. In Shannon's (1948) information theory, the amount of information or symbols depends on the probability of their occurrence. Receivers can define the value of information based on the surprise or uncertainty generated by the information. </p>

                <p>In 2024, Dr. Chou addressed flaws in traditional entropy-based creativity evaluation, including neglecting link distribution and focusing solely on horizontal relationships. The proposed method combines Run Test to analyze randomness and sequence structure, and Logistic Regression to predict creativity based on moves, runs, and probabilities. This approach improves accuracy by incorporating multi-dimensional distributions and offers a practical framework for assessing creativity.</p>
                <p>This webpage applies a novel algorithm based on Dr. Chou's 2024 research. Dr. Chou analyzed 400 randomly generated Linkography diagrams to evaluate creativity levels. Out of these, 176 diagrams were selected for statistical testing, and the logistic regression model's coefficients were derived from variables such as moves, runs, and probabilities. These coefficients, calculated in Dr. Chou's study, are now used in this webpage to determine creativity levels. </p>

            <h3>An overview of Linkography</h3>
            <p>Linkography is a method used to analyze the design collaboration process to evaluate designers' creative productivity. In this technique, participants’ steps, behaviors, or design operations—any actions that can alter the current design state—are defined as a “move.” Each move is then analyzed to determine the relationships between moves and whether a linkage point (link) is established (Goldschmidt, 1990) .</p>
            <p>While Linkography relies on statistical computations, the process of defining actions and determining whether connections exist between them is subjective (kan & Gero, 2008). Thus, Linkography represents a method of evaluation that encompasses both quantitative data and qualitative analysis. Later scholars have refined the Linkography calculation method. Chou (2007) introduced a pattern search algorithm to identify repeated patterns, aiming to eliminate rigid patterns in creative processes. Chou, Chen, and Chou (2014) developed two link distribution indicators: average distance (AD) between clusters and cluster variance (CV). To account for the varying number of linkages, they included a global factor (GF) to adjust the entropy of local factors (LF), resulting in a modified creativity value (Chen & Chou, 2018).
            </p>
            <p>Although Linkography is primarily used for evaluating creativity in collaborative design, its flexible move definitions make it applicable to other types of evaluations as well. Using Linkography for research offers two advantages. Firstly, it is independent of the number of participating designers. Secondly, there are no restrictions on the length of actions, allowing for flexibility in time duration (Ken & Greo, 2008). Such an approach could serve as one of the evaluation methods for non-static art forms. Chou, Chou, and Chen (2013) utilized the temporal characteristics of animated shorts, organizing linear storyboard content into sequential Linkography actions. They confirmed a positive correlation between using Linkography to evaluate creativity in animated shorts and the results of audience surveys. </p>
